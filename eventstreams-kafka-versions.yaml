# Event Streams copy of the kafka versions file, this is to be renamed to `kafka-versions.yaml` at build time as part
# of an automated build process
#
# This file is used to specify the versions of Kafka which will be built
# and supported by the Cluster Operator. It affects both compile time and runtime:
#   * The docker images built (see docker-images/eventstreams-build.sh)
#   * The KAFKA_IMAGE_MAP configuring the CO in the helm-charts (see helm-charts/kafka-version-tpl.sh)
#   * The io.strimzi.operator.cluster.model.KafkaVersion's loaded at runtime
#   * Documentation snippets generated by `make docu_versions`
# The idea is that this is the single place you need to update when changing the supported Kafka versions
#
# Format of this file:
#   <version> is the kafka version number
#   <default> when `true` this is the version to be used by the CO by default when a `Kafka` resource lacks an explicit version. Only one Kafka version can be marked as default.
#   <protocol> is the default `inter.broker.protocol.version` used by this Kafka version
#   <format> is the default `log.message.format.version` used by this Kafka version
#   <url> is the remote (using prefix 'http://' or 'https://') or local (using prefix 'file://') address of the Kafka binary tar archive for this version of Kafka. When using a local file path the absolute path to the binary archive should be used. It is assumed in both cases that the name of the file forms the last section of the path.
#   <checksum> is the SHA512 checksum of the Kafka binary which is specified in the 'url' field.
#   <third-party-libs> is the version string for the third party libraries
